	<h1>Electoral Impact</h1>
	<p>This visualization shows the "electoral impact" of each state. The size (width) of each state's box is relative to it's population divided by its electoral college votes. (Technically, each state's box width is determined by the proportion of the state's electoral votes divided by its population relative to the the total electoral votes in the US divided by the US total population, just to be absolutely clear.) Thus, each voter in the larger-impact states could be considered to have "more impact" in the presidential election than the smaller-impact states.</p>

	<p>Hover over each state for more inforation. (Note: While the states are colored as they voted in 2016 (Red for Republican, Blue for Democrat), Nebraska and Maine do not commit all their electoral votes to one candidate necessarily.) A table of the data is available below the boxes.</p>
